# Marsupilame

Can you tell me what the hell that should be? A M-a-r-ssss-u-peee-laaaa-me? A cute little animal (quite similar to a big cat) in yellow. It lives in the jungle, makes little noises (miouw and RRRrrrrrrrrrrrrrroar and rrrrss and the like). It also is quite clever.

## Traits

* cute
* little

As it always says:

> maybe yes, maybe no... it depends

and...
> why not
